# Console
The **console** is part of Luanti’s GUI and makes it a bit easier to keep track of the [chat](/for-players/chat/) and system messages. You also can type in chat messages and commands and scroll through an extensive log of messages.

## Usage
The console acts similar to the chat window but makes things just a bit more convenient. If you type a line which does not begin with a “/” and hit Enter this line will be send as ordinary chat message. If the line _does_ begin with a “/”, the line will be interpreted as command. See [Server commands](/server-commands/) for detailed usage instructions.

## History
The console has a feature called “history”. Luanti remembers for you which chat messages and commands you have previously entered. With the keys Up and Down you can go through the entries of the history. Careful! This replaces the line with the history entry.

## Scrolling
You can scroll up and down through the message log with Page up and Page down, respectively. The console scrolls automatically for you if you are looking at the bottom of the message log but **not** if you are above.
