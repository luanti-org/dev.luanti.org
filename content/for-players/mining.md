# Mining

**Mining** is one of the most basic activities in Luanti. Mining is the activity of removing a node with a mining [tool](/for-players/tool).

How to mine
-----------

Mining requires the “interact” [privilege](/for-players/privileges) (which is a default privilege).

Mining is done by [pointing](/for-players/pointing) on the desired node and holding the attack button (Left mouse button by default).

Not everything can be mined with all [mining tools](/for-players/tool/#mining-tools). Some tools are better for certain materials. Also, mining often takes some time to finish. The mining speed depends on your tool and the node you want to mine.

Drops
-----

After a block has been mined, it may leave none, one or some [items](/for-players/items) which go straight into your player [inventory](/for-players/inventory). The items left behind are also called the “drop” of the node and it is said that a node _drops_ something after being mined.

Most blocks drop themselves. This is also the default behavior if not specified otherwise by a [mod](/for-players/mods). There are other drops possible. This is the list of possible drop types:

*   itself,
*   a different item,
*   multiple items,
*   _nothing at all_,
*   item or items based on chance (_probability-based drop_).

If the drop wouldn't fit in your inventory, the items literally drop on the floor instead.

Mining speed
------------

The mining speed is determined by [groups](/for-creators/groups).

Mining in [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You start with a [hand](/for-creators/hand) which is itself able to mine a lot of nodes already, but at the worst speed. Axes are good to mine wooden nodes. Pickaxes are good to mine stone-like nodes. Shovels are very fast at digging dirt, sand and gravel. Axes, pickaxes and shovels come in 6 variants: Wooden, stone, steel, bronze, Mese and diamond. In this order, the tools become stronger and stronger and usually mine faster.

**Most nodes drop themselves.** Notable examples for nodes which don’t drop just themselves:

*   Stone (drops 1 Cobblestone)
*   Clay (drops 4 Clay Lumps)
*   Coal Ore (drops 1 Coal Lump)

Notable examples for probability-based drops:

*   Jungle Grass (drops 1 Cotton Seed or itself)
*   Cotton (plant) (drops 0 to 3 Cotton Seeds and 0 to 3 Cotton)

Mining in other games
---------------------

Mining basically works the same in all Luanti games. The tools and digging times are probably different, but the concept stays the same.
