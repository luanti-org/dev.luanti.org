# Mobile (for players)

Luanti supports mobile devices and can be played using a touchscreen.

Please do not download unofficial Luanti builds from the Google Play and any other app store. The builds found there may contain excessive adverts or spyware. They may be distributed under proprietary terms, without the source code, which makes them illegal to develop. They may be old or unsupported.

## Android

There is an official Android version. It's available on the [Luanti website](https://www.luanti.org/downloads/), on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.minetest.minetest) and on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.minetest.minetest/).

See below for how to access the Android data directory for advanced troubleshooting.

## Linux phones

You can also play Luanti on Linux phones. Starting with version 5.9.0[^2], Luanti should work on Linux phones out of the box, without any special configuration required. However, Luanti may work better on Linux phones if you compile it yourself with `-DUSE_SDL2=TRUE`. All official release builds have been compiled with `-DUSE_SDL2=FALSE` so far.

## iOS

There is no iOS support due to legal uncertainties and lack of developer time. While the "MultiCraft" fork of Luanti supports iOS, it contains advertising and is still based on the outdated engine version 5.4.1, so it isn't recommended.

## Accessing Android Data Directory

Starting with Luanti 5.4.2, the Android version now stores its user data in its scoped app storage at `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest`. This is caused by a restriction of recent Android API levels and Google Play policies and it is unfortunately impossible to store it in the old more accessible `/storage/emulated/0/Minetest/` location.

While it is officially intended by Google to not be accessible to regular users, there are ways to circumvent it and  access the folder.

### Total Commander workaround (Android <=12)
[Total Commander](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ghisler.android.TotalCommander) (and possibly other file managers) has a method to workaround the restrictions put in place by Google, by taking advantage of a bug in Android 12 and below* that allows file managers to be given permission to `Android/data/`.

\* Some vendor ROMs based on Android 13 and above may still have this bug present, while phones closely based on stock Android likely have it fixed.

Navigate to `Internal shared storage > Android > data`. Press on the folder named `-> Installed apps`.

![](/images/accessing_android_data/tc_1.webp)

It will prompt you to grant Total Commander access to this folder. Simply press "Yes".

![](/images/accessing_android_data/tc_2.webp)

It will take you to a screen that looks something like this. **Do not navigate into the Luanti folder or any other one**, simply press the "Use this folder" button at the bottom.

![](/images/accessing_android_data/tc_3.webp)

If you get a confirmation prompt, just press the allow button.

![](/images/accessing_android_data/tc_4.webp)

You should be brought to the `/Android/data` directory listing in Total Commander now. Find the `net.minetest.minetest` folder and go inside the `files` folder and then the `Minetest` folder, which is where the engine's user data files now reside.

For instructions on how to create a bookmark shortcut to the folder, see [this forum thread](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=27684).

## Through ADB (Needs computer)
You can access the scoped storage through ADB, a debugging tool part of the [Android platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools). In order to use ADB, you will need to enable USB debugging from the Android developer settings and connect your phone to a computer. On Linux, it should work out of the box. However on Windows you will need to find so called "ADB drivers" from your phone's manufacturer.

ADB is primarily a command-line tool, and you usually would want to use the `adb pull` and `adb push` commands similar to working with something like SCP. ADB also supports tab autocompletion on the remote side, so you can look at the directory structure on your phone while typing out a command. Some example commands:

* **Pushing a world from your computer onto your phone:** `adb push cool_world/ /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest/worlds/`

* **Manually installing a mod not available on ContentDB:** `adb push indev_mod/ /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest/mods/`

* **Backing up a world to your computer:** `adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest/worlds/cool_world/ cool_world_android_backup/`

* **Backing up your entire Android user data to your computer:** `adb pull /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest/ minetest_android_backup/`

The `adb shell` command is also available allowing you to launch a shell on your phone, use `cd /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.minetest.minetest/files/Minetest` to navigate into the user data and manage it with regular Linux terminal commands.
