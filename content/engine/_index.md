# Engine

The engine section is for documentation of the Luanti engine, which consists of a C++ core and a Lua builtin script.

This page contains links to useful information.

Useful Resources
----------------

* [Engine Structure](/Engine/Structure "Engine/Structure") - for an introduction and light reference to the engine's structure. Start here.
* [Basic data structures](/Engine/Basic_data_structures "Engine/Basic data structures") - general data structures.
* [Objects](//objects "Engine/Objects") - documentation on active and static objects.
* Doxygen - For a complete (but often missing comments) reference to code. You'll need to generate this yourself
* See [All rules regarding development](/engine-dev-process/all-rules-regarding-development).

How to help improve documentation
---------------------------------

* Doxygen: We want to document most or all of Luanti core with [Doxygen-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) code comments.

* The usage of doxygen is explained [there](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html).
* Head over to #minetest-dev on [IRC](/irc), and ask someone there to help you get started with documentation. You'll need to download the project through Git and then make your changes.

* Move stuff from [NMPR](/Engine/NMPR "Engine/NMPR") to [Engine Structure](/Engine/Structure "Engine/Structure"), and improve [Engine Structure](/Engine/Structure "Engine/Structure") generally.
