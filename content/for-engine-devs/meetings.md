# Meetings

Core developer meetings are held when needed. They take place in the #luanti-dev [IRC](/about/irc) channel.

This Wiki page contains the meeting plans for upcoming meetings, and meeting notes for previous meetings.

**Only core team should edit this page.** You can raise points to be discussed in an upcoming meeting by contacting a core dev, or messaging on IRC. Please avoid derailing meetings by posting unrelated things whilst discussion about other things is happening.

## Upcoming Meetings

  - Currently 10 PRs ready (merged) that could be included. Not all milestone issues will be fixed in time.

## 2024-02-18

**Organization Discussion**

- Consider converting unfinished / abandoned PRs to draft rather than closing them. Closing signals "no interest" / rejection, whereas draft signals "not ready" and might be more appropriate for "adoption needed" PRs or similar. (appgurueu)
  - Close + "Adoption needed" labels (as always) are better.
- Do we want approvals to be revoked when new commits are pushed? (There's a GH repo setting for this, celeron would have to enable it.) (appgurueu)
  - Wiki update WIP
- When do we want 6.0 to happen? After 5.9, after 5.10, even later? (appgurueu)
  - Not worth it at the moment, too few breakages on the list (doc/breakages.md) (Krock, sfan5)
  - Reference: [https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2024-02-18#i_6153824](https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2024-02-18#i_6153824)

**PR discussion/reviews**

- [Simplify bug report form](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14154): stale, we should take a decision (Zughy)
  - { Desour, sfan5 } for a simple text template, { rubenwardy, Krock } against
- [bulk_get_node](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14225) Worth or not? (Krock)
  - appgurueu might look into it again to judge the reliability of the performance tests
  - node get/set speedup PR: [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14384](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14384)

## 2024-01-21

**Organization Discussion**

- PRs are on the rise and FOSDEM is coming. If it keeps going like this, it'll probably be PR hell all over again. What can we do to avoid both core devs burnouts and contributors being ignored/waiting for ages? Is the roadmap working? (Zughy)
- Suggestion about core devs supporting PRs having to self-assign such PRs, see [here](https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2024-01-15#i_6146007). No general "we" should be accepted (Zughy)
  - Added the assignment guideline to [Git Guidelines](/Git_Guidelines#Issue_and_Pull-Request_Management). (Krock)
  - Try to assign yourself to PRs that you support to ensure they're not forgotten - even more so on such that are not on the roadmap.
  - The guidelines are currently a mess: [https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2024-01-21#i_6147476](https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2024-01-21#i_6147476) - need cleaning up into doc/

**PR discussion/reviews**

- What to do about [Add drawtype sunken and covered](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/14103), see my comment (Zughy)
  - Left a summary of the discussion (Krock)
- When can we have [Reformat the code irr#248](https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/pull/248), and irrlicht merge? (DS)
  - Only irr#276 would be nice to have merged before import
  - Added a milestone for Feb 4 to keep track of the waiting PRs.
- [Irrlicht build fix](https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/pull/281) - I would be grateful about some opinions. (Krock)
  - PR updated with sfan5's suggestion.
- [Inventory stack swap fixes](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12595) - asking who would have time to review it (Krock)
  - Potential reviewers informed.

## 2023-12-10

**Organization Discussion**

- 5.8.0 release
  - See milestone for open tasks

## 2023-11-12

**Organization Discussion**

- 5.8.0 release
  - The [Formspec Android fix](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13872) should be merged beforehand (Krock)
    - grorp also looked into it, without any progress

  - Krock took care of it, ball in OP's court
- [HUD/Formspec replacement PR](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12926) status update? (json (IRC) via Krock)

## 2023-10-15

Mainly a revisit of all milestone points without specific PR reviews.

**Organization Discussion**

- Feature freeze!
  - Revisit all milestone points (Krock)
    - After de-bundling, only minor or obscure issues are left over. Good enough for a 5.8.0 release (Krock)
  - Why did #13885 become a draft? (Krock)
    - grorp is not present for clarifying

## 2023-10-01

**Organization Discussion**

- Feature freeze? (Zughy)
  - Suggestion (see milestone): keep MTG to have enough time to de-bundle in 5.9.0 (Krock)
    - Voted for +2 weeks time to get this done.
    - Caveat: rubenwardy and grorp will not be available much in the next few weeks
  - Feature freeze on Oct 15, release on Oct 29
  - [LTO optimization](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13192) is not a blocker. Can be moved to 5.9.0 if needed.
- [Settings UI tracker](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13476) - Plenty of merged PRs, how much is still required for 5.8.0? (Krock)
  - Non-blocking issues for an eventual release.

**PR discussion/reviews**

- [Dual wield](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11016) - Feedback brainstorming (Krock)
  - Responded.

Concept approval for:

- [Liquid system](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13764) - Concept yes/no? (Krock)
  - Concept approved. Waiting for performance test results.

## 2023-09-17

**Organization Discussion**

- Feature freeze? (Zughy)
  - Milestone set to Oct 15 for feature freeze on Oct 1 (possibly a dev meeting day) (Krock)
  - Reserved additional time to assign milestones and to solve the MTG_follow-up issue [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13800](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13800)

**PR discussion/reviews**

- [Import Irrlicht](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13642) (wsor4035)
  - Generally agreed but needs addressing Desour's requirements before merge
  - It will have to be merged eventually (sfan5)
- [Code style guidelines for Java code](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13700) There are already guidelines for C++ and Lua code, but not (Android-specific) Java code. It can be as simple as, "Use Android Studio's linter/formatter." (srifqi)
  - Volunteers are welcome to extend this page, e.g. srifqi: [/Android_code_style_guidelines](/Android_code_style_guidelines)
- A follow up for [Issue 13583](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13583): Is there a draft already that I missed? This can be great for documenting supported OS/env. (srifqi)
  - The suggested document is currently WIP
  - Be clear how old toolchains we support, e.g. by supported Ubuntu LTS versions to use newer libraries or C++ revisions (Krock)
- [Dual Wielding](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11016) has been waiting for a feedback since 6 months. Since we're busy, I'd suggest to prioritize MTG removal and postpone this feature to 5.9, so that core devs can review it without any pressure (Zughy)
  - No progress and the issues could yet not be solved. Removed milestone, marked as draft.

Concept approval for:

- [Refactored the liquid system, and added an optional feature for liquids to flow to the next slope](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13764)
  - Comment written to clarify the situation (Krock)
- [Fix liquid falling if in "float" group](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13789)
  - Concept approved by Krock

## 2023-06-25

**Organization Discussion**

- Start considering a hypothetical new name, possibly privately. See [Here](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13510) (Zughy)
  - Will be discussed internally

**PR discussion/reviews**

- Less than two months to [5.8](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/milestone/22): we should consider what to do with a few issues/PRs in the milestone to avoid a last month burst (Zughy)
  - Not yet urgent. PRs and issues will be resolved when people have time for it.

Also discussed:

- [De-bundle Minetest Game](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13550)
  - Question about "featured" marks to make it more visible to newcomers

## 2023-05-28

**Organization Discussion**

- welcome srifqi
- 5.7.1 release (justified by [Android crashes](https://irc.luanti.org/minetest-dev/2023-05-23#i_6086412))

**PR discussion/reviews**

- Discuss and concept approve or close ["Roadmap: needs approval" PRs](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22Roadmap%3A+Needs+approval%22)
  - [make falling node checks check for protection](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12966) TL;DR: Some server made ladders falling, and protection doesn't protect from fall through on_punch by other players. Possible solutions include making the registered on_punch/on_dig/on_placenode function overwrite-able, or only checking for protection in on_punch. What to do? (DS)
    - Removed roadmap approval needed label. (DS)

## 2023-05-14

**Organization Discussion**

- close all the Jude's PRs that haven't been adopted (Zughy)
  - done

**PR discussion/reviews**

- ["Dual Wielding"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11016) I think OP is waiting for a core dev feedback, see their last comment (Zughy)
  - ???

## 2023-04-30

Notes inherited from the meeting 2023-04-16

**Organization Discussion**

- now that 5.7 has been released, we should write down a roadmap for 5.8 onwards (Zughy)
  - No special action taken. Might need picking up later again.

**PR discussion/reviews**

- ["Move code style guidelines into repo"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12749) Do we want this? (I'm myself neutral now that code blocks are no longer broken on the wiki.) (DS)
  - Generally okay but updating it might be cumbersome. Guidelines should apply to all Minetest (group) projects (Krock)
  - Closed by author (DS).
- ["Conditional textures for nodes, bulk texture changing"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13417) Support for this? Or for the alternative linked in the original post? Or none? (Zughy)
  - Yet another feature request. No interest shown. Marked as low priority.
- ["Add utility script to update/generate \*.tr files"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13464) roadmap approval or rejection?
  - Answer posted in [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13437](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13437)
- [Irrlicht as a submodule](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13215) - how to fix Android compatibility? Ideas are welcome.
  - Fix the Android script later? Waiting on numberZero when they have time (Krock)

## 2023-04-02

**Organization Discussion**

- Where should we post next meetings notice? (Zughy)
  - rubenwardy moved them to [https://github.com/orgs/minetest/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/minetest/discussions)
  - People with read access: MTE + MTG + triagers
- Complaints about connected glass changes - changes the meaning of glasslike_framed_optional and there's no way for texture packs to control it.
  - Reverted for now. Let's keep it as a subject for 5.8.0-dev
- 5.7.0 release
  - Aiming for 9 April or earlier. Not enough developer activity in this meeting.

## 2023-03-19

**Organization Discussion**

- Current roadmap evaluation and draft of the next one (Zughy)
  - Still need focus on UI/UX improvements, entities were not touched at all, de-hardcoding shouldn't be a point

## 2023-03-05

**Organization Discussion**

- Feature freeze? (Zughy)
  - Yes, now (sfan5, x2048).
- Dedicate the upcoming version to Jude/TurkeyMcMac (Zughy, original proposal by jp)
  - sfan5 will do that when updating the credits
- We're choking on PRs again: shouldn't MT advertise itself more so to potentially find new core devs and/or recruit existing contributors? (Zughy)
  - There is not much that can be done about it, wait for new devs.

**PR discussion/reviews**

- ["SSCSM execution"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13046) (TurkeyMcMac)
  - Should the PR be reviewed in parts? If so, it can be reviewed at this point.
  - It would be good to divide up the work of implementing the various SSCSM APIs, if other people have time to work on this. See the TODO list in the PR description. To see how to implement SSCSM APIs, you can look at src/script/lua_api/l_csm.cpp and src/script/lua_api/l_csm_nodemeta.cpp.
  - Meeting note: x2048 might have a look at it. It should be merged in small chunks, preferably with unittests (Krock)
- ["Reorder client initialization"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12189#issuecomment-1130461922) needs sfan's take to unlock the status of the PR (Zughy)
  - sfan5 unblocked it; will be reviewed when time comes.
- [MariaDB](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/13266) Yes or No (Krock: Yes) - who could test this easily? (Krock)
  - obsolete entry
- ["Dual Wielding"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11016) How should we go ahead with this? (sfan5)
  - Yes: item definition flag (sfan5 answered)
- [Add world-independent storage directory for mods](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12315) - approved, but there's concerns about how multiple instances of Minetest running will cause issues for modders. Is this acceptable? What should modders do in these situations? Is the design fundamentally flawed (rubenwardy)
  - Ideas: callback-based updates for sane locking (sfan5)

## 2023-01-08

**Organization Discussion**

- ["Host the generated Lua API documentation under api.luanti.org"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13072) (Zughy)
  - Assigned to rubenwardy to move it to GitHub
- Feature freeze starting on January 22? I suggest to keep every feature currently listed in the milestone (Zughy)
  - focus on the Privacy Policy (sample available)
  - postponed the main menu (settings) rework to 5.8.0
  - minetest.get_player_window_information reviews requested
  - Dual Wield should be reviewed because it's what the players want

**PR discussion/reviews**

- ["Static binary builds for Linux on common architectures"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/13037): yes, no? (Zughy)
  - AppImages are coming and Docker is an universal solution. Additional static binaries are not necessary.
- ["Allow zoom even with overwritten default FOV"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12953): There seems to be some disagreement on this in the comments. Is the change acceptable? (TurkeyMcMac)
  - Handled (Krock)
- ["Add node texture variants"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12928): What item properties should be allowed to vary by variant? (TurkeyMcMac)
  - Currently supported: "tiles", "overlay_tiles", and "special_tiles"
  - Others that could be supported:
    - "inventory_image" and "wield_image": May be unnecessary as there's a separate PR for settings these using item metadata.
    - "mesh": Could be complicated to implement, I haven't looked into it.
  - Should all properties vary based on the same bit field ("param2_variant") or is this bad API design? (A single bit field is not a functional limitation. It is still possible to let properties effectively vary independently by making a variant for each possible combination.)
  - \-> Feedbacks given for the concept. Might be discussed again in the next meeting.

## 2022-12-04

**Organization Discussion**

- 5.7 release when? (Zughy)
  - somewhen in January is good (rubenwardy, sfan5)
- we should decide on the [new roadmap](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/12746) (sfan5)
  - Commented an analysis of the previous roadmap and suggestions on how to increase "success rate" (Krock)

**PR discussion/reviews**

- ["Dual wielding"](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11016): can someone please take care of this PR if the author doesn't come back? It's a huge feature for modders (Zughy)
  - Author came back. Check the progress as usual.

## 2022-10-23

**PR discussion/reviews**

- [Add vector() constructor](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12772) - It seems this proposal is controversial. Its fate should be decided. (TurkeyMcMac)

## 2022-10-09

**PR discussion/reviews**

- [Add support for attached facedir/4dir nodes (comment)](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/11432#issuecomment-1263562675) - Thoughts on adding this as part of the PR? (TurkeyMcMac)
- [Add callback on_mapblocks_changed](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12739) - Decide whether this is the right approach. We could go for something with node granularity, but it would probably be more expensive. (TurkeyMcMac)
- [Implement some VoxelManip functionality safely using LuaJIT's FFI library](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12611) - Decide whether the added complexity is worth it. (TurkeyMcMac)
- [Use .md extension for markdown files](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/12449) - Please decide once and for all (Zughy)
- Shader brightness issue

## 2022-09-25

- Is 5.0.2 needed for the newlines in setting name bug? ([https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8590](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8590))
  - Yet no clear decision
- What is needed to have good mobs in Minetest (- Game)?
  - I suggest roping in mob devs like tenplus1 and stujones1
  - No blood included. Belongs to another mod
- Combine pathfinder issues into a single issue

- Does 1 disapproval block a PR?
  - SmallJoker seems to think it does

**Proposed order of merging formspec PRs**

The idea is to merge the most important PR first (top of list) to not drown in conflicts: **[https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/projects/6](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/projects/6)**

- style\[\] [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8383](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8383)
- scroll_container\[\] [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8591](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/8591)
- list spacing [https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/7971](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/7971) (perhaps integrate into style\[\]?)
- Unarelith's refactors

 Minetest developer meeting 2017-05-20

Last chance to merge/improve the remaining PR before feature freeze:

Old business:
 * Additional hooks for inventory manipulations callbacks (#4035)
   * Krock was working on it (#5647), but had an issue with a mysterious crash bug.  Progress?
 * Timed move (#1489)
   * Merge/close?
   * nerzhul: close for me
   * nore: Merge
   * Krock: Merge
 * Split block position in SQLite3 database (and use R*Tree) (#1845)
   * Rebased, performance tests to do soon(tm).
   * nerzhul: performance is a little bit slower, but it's ridiculous compared to mapblock
    deserialization part (no bench to show it atm, but i did it 2 years ago on my fork, and SQLite was improved since this date)
 * Add list_predict formspec element (#1988)
   * sofar worked on a rebase a while ago.  Close or merge a modern version?
 * New screenshots for website (web#78)  https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti.github.io/issues/78
   * ShadowNinja: "good" screenshots are fairly subjective and it doesn't look like we're actually
    getting anywhere near a decision in the issue thread, therefore I propose assigning someone to choose and install new screenshots.
   * > Calinou will handle it


New business:
 * First, release blockers:
 * https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5767 Don't add damage flash while punch texture modifier is active #5767
   * > Bugfix, punted to next meeting.
 * https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/5782 [CSM] Disable preview mod before release #5782
   * CSM disabled by default anyways since it's experimental
   * > Fixed by #5554
 * https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/issues/5728 Block instadig after tool switch #5728
   * > Fixed by #5785
 * nerzhul:
 * https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5732 (CSM nodedefs/itemdefs read)
 * maybe close https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5654
 * Single/Multiplayer tab merge https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5627 (user UI experience)
   * > Merge with minor changes
 * Create world better experience: https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5589
 * Permit to enable/disable mods on CSM  https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5554 (very important)
   * ShadowNina: CSM is experimental, so I don't think any CSM issues should be blockers
     * nerzhul: here the problem if a user enable client side modding his experience will be affected by this preview mod, dedicated to modders)
   * > nerzhul will merge
 * https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/5589 (start world after creation)
 * LMDB backend (https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/pull/4206)
   * nerzhul: Close? We already have 5 backends to maintain and we already cover all the use cases (client usage, performance usage, reliability usage)

- Timed move (#1489)
  - Merge/close?
- Use a settings object for the main settings (#1949)
  - Rebased, should be merged soon.
- Split block position in SQLite3 database (and use R\*Tree) (#1845)
  - Rebased, performance tests to do soon(tm).
  - nerzhul: performance is a little bit slower, but it's ridiculous compared to mapblock deserialization part (no bench to show it atm, but i did it 2 years ago on my fork, and SQLite was improved since this date)
- Add list_predict formspec element (#1988)
  - sofar worked on a rebase a while ago. Close or merge a modern version?

**New business:** (mainly oldest or least recently updated PRs that haven't been handled yet)

- Added formspec element 'KeyEventBox' for char-based input by ninnghazad (#1737)
  - Closed: better done with client-side mods.

Old business:

    "Delayed shutdown" merged by nerzhul.
    "Disable Android LevelDB" rebased by nore and merged by nerzhul.
    "Add configurable key bindings" (#1439) rebased by nore, needs tweaks and merge.
    Additional hooks for inventory manipulations callbacks (#4035)
        Needs rebase and cleanup, volunteers?
    Rename .txt to .md (#5451)?

New business:  (PRs obtained by sorting by age on GitHub)
    Schedule Minetest subgame meeting?
    Coverity: https://scan.coverity.com/projects/12441
        Need to triage issues, many legitimate issues to fix.
    Timed move (#1489)
    Added formspec element 'KeyEventBox' for char-based input (#1737)
    Add ability to escape commands with a back-slash (#1768)
        <ShadowNinja> I may want to tweak this so that it doesn't strip the slash when you type "\foo" (or maybe not?
     It should at least work for the client-side dot-commands too)
    Split block position in SQLite3 database (and use R*Tree) (#1845)
    Use a settings object for the main settings (#1949)
        <ShadowNinja> I also unified Initialize and InitializeAsync, which was necessary to implement this.
        I think the unification is worth merging even without the settings object change.  This conflicts with just about
        the entire ScriptAPI, so I don't want to rebase it too often :-)
    Add listpredict to the formspec (#1988)
    Add non-global mod namespaces (#2039)
```
