# Mission Statement

Luanti Documentation will be the central resource for the Luanti project as a whole where contributors and writers collaborate to author well-tested, understandable, categorized, and searchable information based on the current state of the Luanti engine. Documentation will cover:

* Comprehensive API reference, examples, and guides
* Engine reference and internal structures
* Server and platform (player-facing) usage and guides

Our roadmap can be found at [GitHub issue #113: Roadmap](https://github.com/minetest/dev.luanti.org/issues/113).
