# Map generator features

This page shows the various special features which [map generators](/mapgen "Map generator") have and explains how to use them.

{{< notice note >}}
This page doesn't list all available mapgen features. For a full reference, search for `mg_flags` and `mg*_spflags` in [minetest.conf.example](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/minetest.conf.example) instead.

## Features shared between all mapgens except singlenode

### Dungeons

Setting `mg_flags`, `dungeons` flag (enabled by default)

* Dungeons are hollow underground structures. Many pathways and stairs connect a complex system of rooms.
* The nodes used by dungeons are defined in biome definitions.
* *Cobblestone dungeon, as of Minetest Game 0.4.7*

### Decorations

Setting `mg_flags`, `decorations` flag (enabled by default)

* Decorations are additional structures placed on top of the surface. These are registered by games and mods using the decoration API.
* Decorations can be small plants such as grass, flowers, cacti, or they can even be entire trees or buildings.
* This flag doesn't affect mapgen v6 trees (see [Mapgen v6](/mapgen/#v6)).

### Caves

Setting `mg_flags`, `caves` flag (enabled by default)

* Caves are air pockets found underground at any height. Caves can be very small hollow places or can be very complex interconnected tunnel systems. Cave entrances can commonly found on the surface. The cave style greatly varies between the different map generators.
* There is a "cave liquids" system that results in some caves being flooded. Biome definitions can specify the liquid nodes to be used.
* *Cave in Minetest Game 5.0.0*

* *A water lake in v7, as of Minetest Game 0.4.15*

* *A lava lake in v6, as of Minetest Game 0.4.7*

## Features shared between fewer mapgens

### Caverns

This enables the creation of caves with very large rooms, also called caverns.

Caverns depend on caves being enabled. Caverns are shared between:

* v5: Setting `mgv5_spflags`, `caverns` flag (enabled by default)
* v7: Setting `mgv7_spflags`, `caverns` flag (enabled by default)
* carpathian: Setting `mgcarpathian_spflags`, `caverns` flag (enabled by default)
* flat: Setting `mgflat_spflags`, `caverns` flag (disabled by default)
* valleys: Always enabled

## Mapgen `v7` features

### Mountains

Setting `mgv7_spflags`, `mountains` flag (enabled by default)

### Rivers

Setting `mgv7_spflags`, `ridges` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables rivers at sea level. They aggressively cut through the terrain and sometimes create canyon-like structures. Since these rivers can make the terrain quite difficult to navigate, it can be useful to disable them.
* *Typical ridge in v7, Minetest Game*

### Floatlands (experimental)

Setting `mgv7_spflags`, `floatlands` flag (disabled by default)

* Floatlands are large chunks of land generated in the sky, by default from Y=1024 to Y=4096. They are experimental and subject to change.
* For more information, see the ["Warning: Rewrite of Mapgen V7 floatlands"](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=23764) forum thread by paramat.
* *Minetest Game floatlands in 5.0.0*

## Mapgen `v6` features

### Trees

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `trees` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables v6's hardcoded decorations: regular trees, apple trees, jungle trees and jungle grass in jungles and pine trees in taiga biomes (see [Mapgen v6](/mapgen/#v6)). 
* *A forest of regular trees in Minetest Game 0.4.9*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/Mapgen_v6_0_4_9.jpg)

### Snow biomes

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `snowbiomes` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables the Tundra and Taiga biomes. This also automatically enables the jungles setting.
* *Pine trees in a snowy region, as of Minetest Game 0.4.13*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/1200px-Snow_pines.jpg)

### Jungle biomes

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `jungles` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables the Jungle biome which includes jungle trees and jungle grass.
* *Jungle biome as of Minetest Game 0.4.7*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/1200px-Jungle_0.4.7.jpg)

### Biome blending

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `biomeblend` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables a smooth transition between biomes.
* *Biome blending in action between plains and a desert in Minetest Game*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/Mapgen_v6_biomeblend.jpg)

### Mud flow

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `mudflow` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables soil erosion. It moves dirt that sits on the edge of vertical drops and moves it to the base of that drop.

### Flat

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `flat` flag (disabled by default)

* Will generate a flat world in the v6 style with lakes, trees and caves. You should prefer using the `flat` map generator instead.

### Temples

Setting `mgv6_spflags`, `temples` flag (enabled by default)

* Enables generation of larger dungeons called desert temples in v6 desert biomes.
* If disabled, normal dungeons are generated instead.
* *Desert stone dungeon, as of Minetest Game 0.4.13*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/1200px-Desert_dungeon_desert_stone.jpg)

## Mapgen `flat` features

This mapgen has support for lakes and hills which are disabled by default.

### Hills

Setting `mgflat_spflags`, `hills` flag (disabled by default)

* Increases the terrain height at some points to form hills. These hills become quite big sometimes.
* *Hill in the flat mapgen in Minetest Game*  
  ![](/images/mapgen/Mapgen_flat_hills.jpg)

### Lakes

Setting `mgflat_spflags`, `lakes` flag (disabled by default)

* Lowers the terrain at some points to form lakes. These lakes can become quite large sometimes.
* *Small lake in the flat mapgen in Minetest Game*
