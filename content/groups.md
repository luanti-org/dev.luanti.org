# Groups


**Groups** is a concept for [Nodes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Nodes "Nodes"), [Items](https://wiki.luanti.org/Items "Items") and [Tools](https://wiki.luanti.org/index.php?title=Tools&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tools (page does not exist)") in Luanti. Any of these may be a member of a group or multiple groups, or none at all. Groups are used mainly for [crafting](https://wiki.luanti.org/Crafting "Crafting") recipes, to determine damage, to determine digging time and lots of other stuff as well.
