# Lua code style guidelines
This is largely based on [the Python style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) except for some indentation and language syntax differences. When in doubt, consult that guide.

Note that these are only _guidelines_ for more readable code. In some (rare) cases they may result in _less_ readable code. Use your best judgement.

* Incorrect or outdated comments are worse than no comments.

* Avoid inline comments, unless they're very short.

* Write comments to clarify anything that may be confusing. Don't write comments that describe things that are obvious from the code.

Good:

```lua
width = width - 2  -- Adjust for 1px border on each side
```


Bad:

```lua
width = width - 2  -- Decrement width by two
```


* Comments should follow English grammar rules, this means **starting with a capital letter**, using commas and apostrophes where appropriate, and **ending with a period**. The period may be omitted in single-sentence comments. If the first word of a comment is an identifier, its casing should not be changed. **Check the spelling.**

```lua
-- This is a properly formatted comment.
-- This isnt.              (missing apostrophe)
-- neither is this.        (lowercase first letter)
```


* Comments should have a space between the comment characters and the first word.

```lua
--This is wrong.
-- This is right.
```


* Inline comments should be separated from the code by two spaces.

```lua
foo()  -- A proper comment.
```


* If you write comments for a documentation generation tool, write the comments in LuaDoc format.

* Short multi-line comments should use the regular single-line comment style.

* Long multi-line comments should use Lua's multi-line comment format with no leading characters except a `--` before the closer.

```lua
--[[
Very long
multi-line comment.
--]]
```


Lines, spaces, and indentation
------------------------------

* Indentation is done with one tab per indentation level.

* **Lines are wrapped at 80 characters** where possible, with a hard limit of 90. If you need more you're probably doing something wrong.

### Continuation lines

* Conditional expressions have continuation lines indented by two tabs.

```lua
if long_function_call(with, many, arguments) and
		another_function_call() then
	do_something()
end
```


* Function arguments are indented by two tabs if multiple arguments are in a line, same for definition continuations.

```lua
foo(bar, biz, "This is a long string..."
		baz, qux, "Lua")

function foo(a, b, c, d,
		e, f, g, h)
	[…]
end
```


* If the function arguments contain a table, it's indented by one tab and if the arguments get own lines, it's indented like a table.

```lua
register_node("name", {
	"This is a long string...",
	0.3,
})

list = filterlist.create(
	preparemodlist,
	comparemod,
	function()
		return "no comma at the end"
	end
)
```


* When strings don't fit into the line, you should add the string (changes) to the next line(s) indented by one tab.

```lua
longvarname = longvarname ..
	"Thanks for reading this example!"

local retval =
	"size[11.5,7.5,true]" ..
	"label[0.5,0;" .. fgettext("World:") .. "]" ..
	"label[1.75,0;" .. data.worldspec.name .. "]"
```


* When breaking around a binary operator you should break after the operator.

```lua
if a or b or c or d or
		e or f then
	foo()
end
```


### Empty lines

* Use a single empty line to separate sections of long functions.

* Use two empty lines to separate top-level functions and large tables.

* Do not use a empty line after conditional, looping, or function opening statements.

Good:

```lua
function foo()
	if x then
		bar()
	end
end
```


Bad:

```lua
function foo()

	if x then

		bar()
	end
end
```


* Don't leave white-space at the end of lines.

### Spaces

* Spaces are not used around parenthesis, brackets, or curly braces.

Good:

```lua
foo({baz=true})
bar[1] = "Hello world"
```


Bad:

```lua
foo ( { baz=true } )
bar [ 1 ]
```


* Spaces are used after, but not before, commas and semicolons.

Good:

Bad:

* Spaces are used around binary operators with following exceptions:
    * There mustn't be spaces around the member access operator (".")
    * Spaces around the concatenation operator ("..") are optional.
    * In short one-line table definitions the spaces around the equals sign can be omitted.
    * When in-/decrementing a variable by 1, the spaces around the + and - operator can be omitted if you want to "get the neighbour" of something, e.g. when increasing some counter variable.

Good:

```lua
local num = 2 * (3 / 4)
foo({bar=true})
foo({bar = true})
local def = {
	foo = true,
	bar = false,
}
i = i+1
sometable[#sometable+1] = v
```


Bad:

```lua
local num=2*(3/4)
local def={
	foo=true,
	bar=false,
}
playerpos.y = playerpos.y+1  -- playerpos.y is not an integer
```


* Use spaces to align related things, but don't go overboard:

Good:

```lua
local node_up   = core.get_node(pos_up)
local node_down = core.get_node(pos_down)
-- Too long relative to the other lines, don't align with it
local node_up_1_east_2_north_3 = core.get_node(pos_up_1_east_2_north_3)
```


Bad:

```lua
local x                       = true
local very_long_variable_name = false

local foobar    = true
local unrelated = {}
```


### Tables

* **Small tables may be placed on one line.** Large tables have one entry per line, with the opening and closing braces on lines without items; and with a comma after the last item.

Good:

```lua
local foo = {bar=true}
foo = {
	bar = 0,
	biz = 1,
	baz = 2,
}
```


Bad:

```lua
foo = {bar = 0,
	biz = 1,
	baz = 2}
foo = {
	bar = 0, biz = 1,
	baz = 2
}
```


* In list-style tables where each element is short multiple elements may be placed on each line.

```lua
local first_eight_letters = {
	"a", "b", "c", "d",
	"e", "f", "g", "h",
}
```


Naming
------

* **Functions and variables should be named in `lowercase_underscore_style`**, with the exception of constructor-like functions such as `PseudoRandom()`, which should use UpperCamelCase.

* Don't invent compound words. Common words like `filename` are okay, but mashes like `getbox` and `collisiondetection` aren't.

* Avoid leading and/or trailing underscores. They're ugly and can be hard to see.

Misc
----

* Don't put multiple statements on the same line.

* You can put conditionals / loops with small conditions and bodies on one line. This is discouraged for all but the smallest ones though.

Good:

```lua
local f, err = io.open(filename, "r")
if not f then return err end

if     foo then return foo
elseif bar then return bar
elseif qux then return qux
end
```


Bad:

```lua
if not f and use_error then error(err) elseif not f then return err end
```


* Don't compare values explicitly to `true`, `false`, or `nil`, unless it's really needed.

Good:

```lua
local f, err = io.open(filename, "r")
if not f then return err end

local t = {"a", true, false}
for i = 1, 5 do
	-- Needs an explicit nil check to avoid triggering
	-- on false, which is a valid value.
	if t[i] == nil then
		t[i] = "Default"
	end
end
```


Bad:

```lua
if f == nil then return err end
```


* Don't use unnecessary parenthesis unless they improve readability a lot.

```lua
if y then bar() end -- Good
if (not x) then foo() end -- Bad
```


* Write function definitions of the form `function foo()` instead of the lambda form `foo = function()`, except when inserting functions in tables inline, where only the second form will work.

* **Avoid globals like the plague.** The only globals that you should create are namespace tables—and even those might eventually be phased out.

* Don't let functions get too large. Maximum length depends on complexity; simple functions can be longer than complex functions.
