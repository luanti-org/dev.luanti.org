# Cheating
Cheating means misusing features or exploits in the client, [mods](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mods "Mods"), or [games](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games "Games"), in an unintended way to have an advantage over other players.

What is considered cheating and what isn't varies among server operators and players. If a feature is obviously unintended (e.g. duplicating items in some way), please refrain from using it, or at least ask if it is allowed. Use common sense.

**Please don't add examples of serious bugs/exploits to this page. That should be left as an excercise to readers.**
