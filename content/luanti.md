**Luanti** is a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) to create various games based on [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) gameplay, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft, and the like. Luanti was originally created by Perttu Ahola (alias “[celeron55](https://wiki.luanti.org/Celeron55 "Celeron55")”).

The basic idea of each game is always the same: The [player](https://wiki.luanti.org/Player "Player") is thrown into a huge [world](https://wiki.luanti.org/World "World") made out of cubes/[blocks](https://wiki.luanti.org/Blocks "Blocks"). Most of the time, these cubes make the landscape and these blocks can be [removed](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mining "Mining") and [placed](https://wiki.luanti.org/Building "Building") almost entirely freely. Using the collected [items](https://wiki.luanti.org/Items "Items"), new [tools](https://wiki.luanti.org/Tool "Tool") and other items can be [crafted](https://wiki.luanti.org/Crafting "Crafting"). [Games](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games "Games") in Luanti can, however, be much more complex than this.

A core concept of Luanti is a built-in [modding](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mods "Mods") capability, based on the Lua programming language. Mods allow one or more certain aspects of an existing game to be modified. Luanti mods can be as simple as adding a few decorational blocks or very complex by (for example) introducing complex new gameplay concepts or generating a completely different kind of world, and many other things. For the player, using a new mod requires to copy or extract some files into a certain location and pressing some buttons in Luanti's interface.

Luanti can be played alone or [online](https://wiki.luanti.org/Server "Server") together with multiple players.

Name
----

In the beginning, Luanti was called “**Minetest-c55**”. The “c55” stands for “celeron55”, the original creator. The “Minetest” was chosen simply because he wanted to test how far he could come with a Minecraft clone. (But today, Luanti is a game engine for all sorts of voxel games, not just Minecraft clones.)

As the project attracted a larger following, the ”-c55” was dropped and so the new name was “**Minetest**” and that name stuck for many years. But many people didn’t like the name because of the “test” in the name.

After years of brainstorming and discussion, a decision has finally been made: On October 13 2024, it was [renamed](https://blog.minetest.net/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/) to **Luanti**, the current name. The name was explained in the blog as follows:

> “Luanti” is a wordplay on the Finnish word _luonti_ (“creation”) and the programming language Luanti employs for games and mods, _Lua_.
