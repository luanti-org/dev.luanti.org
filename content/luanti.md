# Luanti


![](/images/luanti/Luanti_logo.png)

**Luanti** is a [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) to create various games based on [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) gameplay, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft, and the like. Luanti was originally created by Perttu Ahola (alias “[celeron55](/celeron55)”).

The basic idea of each game is always the same: The [player](/player) is thrown into a huge [world](/worlds) made out of cubes/[blocks](/nodes). Most of the time, these cubes make the landscape and these blocks can be removed and placed almost entirely freely. Using the collected [items](/items), new [tools](/tool) and other items can be crafted. Games in Luanti can, however, be much more complex than this.

A core concept of Luanti is a built-in [modding](/mods) capability, based on the Lua programming language. Mods allow one or more certain aspects of an existing game to be modified. Luanti mods can be as simple as adding a few decoration blocks or very complex by (for example) introducing complex new gameplay concepts or generating a completely different kind of world, and many other things. For the player, using a new mod requires to copy or extract some files into a certain location and pressing some buttons in Luanti's interface.

Luanti can be played alone or [online](/server) together with multiple players.

Games for Luanti can be found on [ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/packages/?type=game).

Name
----

In the beginning, Luanti was called “**Minetest-c55**”. The “c55” stands for “celeron55”, the original creator. The “Minetest” was chosen simply because he wanted to test how far he could come with a Minecraft clone. (But today, Luanti is a game engine for all sorts of voxel games, not just Minecraft clones.)

As the project attracted a larger following, the ”-c55” was dropped and so the new name was “**Minetest**” and that name stuck for many years. But many people didn’t like the name because of the “test” in the name.

After years of brainstorming and discussion, a decision has finally been made: On October 13 2024, it was [renamed](https://blog.luanti.org/2024/10/13/Introducing-Our-New-Name/) to **Luanti**, the current name. The name was explained in the blog as follows:

> “Luanti” is a wordplay on the Finnish word _luonti_ (“creation”) and the programming language Luanti employs for games and mods, _Lua_.
