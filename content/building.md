# Building

**Building**—also called **placing**—is the activity of placing blocks next to other blocks. It is one of the most basic things you can do in Luanti.

Building requires the “interact” [privilege](https://wiki.luanti.org/Privileges "Privileges") (a default privilege).

To build, one must wield something which can be built, [point](https://wiki.luanti.org/Pointing "Pointing") to something which can be built to and press the build key (Right mouse button by default). Most [blocks](https://wiki.luanti.org/Blocks "Blocks") can be built. Building is, unlike [mining](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mining "Mining"), always instantly done. On blocks which can be [used](https://wiki.luanti.org/Using "Using") (e.g. [Chest](https://wiki.luanti.org/Chest "Chest"), [Furnace](https://wiki.luanti.org/Furnace "Furnace"), [Sign](https://wiki.luanti.org/Sign "Sign"), etc.), you have to press [Sneak](https://wiki.luanti.org/Sneaking "Sneaking")+Right-click instead.

Minetest Game
-------------

By building a [slab](https://wiki.luanti.org/Slab "Slab") onto another slab of the same material, a full block of the same material is created. It is possible to build _inside_ some nodes which entirely destroys them. [Air](https://wiki.luanti.org/Air "Air"), can always be replaced, as well as liquids like [water](https://wiki.luanti.org/Water "Water"), too. Many [plants](https://wiki.luanti.org/Category:Plants "Category:Plants") like [grass](https://wiki.luanti.org/Grass "Grass") can also be built inside.

For [Tree](https://wiki.luanti.org/Tree "Tree"), [Acacia Tree](https://wiki.luanti.org/Acacia_Tree "Acacia Tree"), etc. and [Cactus](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cactus "Cactus"), the initial facing direction will be from the block face you placed the block on. E.g. if you placed a tree on the floor, it will stand vertically, and if you placed it at the side of a block, it will be horizontal. By holding down the Sneak key while building, you can reverse the placement behaviour: Placing a block vertically rotates it horizontally, and vice-versa.
