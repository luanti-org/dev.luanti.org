# IRC

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is one of the platforms that Luanti uses for real-time chat. IRC also serves as a common ground between other platforms such as Discord and Matrix.

All the engaged people from the community and the developer team can be found there, and most prolific modders will also be available there.

## Channels

All of the Luanti IRC channels are on irc.libera.chat. You can connect either via webchat or install an external IRC client (see [IRC software](#irc-software)).

### General channels

The primary IRC channels for the project. They are also bridged to the [Luanti Discord server](https://discord.gg/minetest) with full message history available as well as bridged to rooms in the [Luanti Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#minetest:tchncs.de). For IRC users who do not have a bouncer, the logs of the IRC channels are publicly available on [irc.luanti.org](https://irc.luanti.org/).

### International channels

Channels for discussion about Luanti in other languages. The activity in these channels are unknown, and no bridges or logging is available for these.

## IRC Software

If you like to chat a lot, webchat is not very convenient. So you should download an IRC client program. Here is some recommended Free IRC software:

- [HexChat](https://hexchat.github.io/): Feature-rich IRC client for Windows and Linux, technically abandoned but still very functional.
- [Revolution IRC](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.mrarm.irc/): IRC client for Android devices. Using a bouncer is recommended to not repeatedly get disconnected when using IRC from a phone.
- [The Lounge](https://thelounge.chat/): Self-hostable server software acting both as a web IRC client and an IRC bouncer.
- [ZNC](https://wiki.znc.in/ZNC): IRC bouncer software, install this on a server and connect to it with a regular IRC client to always stay connected to IRC channels, with channel history preserved as long as the bouncer stays online.
- [irssi](https://irssi.org/): Pure console client for terminal users.

## Rules

Some people don't know how to behave in IRC, so here are some simple rules:

- Don't ask if you can ask questions, just ask
- Be patient when you ask something, people might not be around
- Don't spam
- Don't flood the channel with messages or bot commands
- Use a pastebin, such as [0bin](https://0bin.net) if you want to post more than 4 lines (e.g. error messages or code)
- Annoying, racist or any form of derogatory term against any user or channel operator will probably get you quieted or even banned.
- If you're going to ask someone something, saying "please" goes a very long way.
- The channels are not playgrounds and are frequently used for talks which are not off-topic.
- Off-topic is allowed, but excessive use of it is disallowed.
- Link shorteners are discouraged for URLs that are not very long.
