# Groups

**Groups** is a concept for [nodes](/for-players/nodes), [items](/for-players/items) and [tools](/for-players/tool) in Luanti. Any of these may be a member of a group or multiple groups, or none at all. Groups are used mainly for crafting recipes, to determine damage, to determine digging time and lots of other stuff as well.

{{< notice info>}}Below are some sample groups from [Minetest Game](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Minetest/minetest_game/). [Mods](/for-players/mods) often remove or heavily modify these groups, so they may not apply to other games.{{< /notice >}}

*   oddly\_breakable\_by\_hand: can be broken by [hand](/for-creators/hand).
*   crumbly: stuff like dirt and sand. Shovels are great to break nodes in this group.
*   cracky: tough stuff like stone. Pickaxes are great to break nodes in this group.
*   choppy: something that can be cut using force; eg. trees, wooden planks. Axes are great chopping these down.
*   fleshy: living things like animals and players. Swords deal great damage to them.
*   snappy: something that can be cut using fine tools; eg. leaves, small plants, wire, sheets of metal. Swords can be used to dig these, but they wear out quickly.
*   explody: especially prone to explosions.
