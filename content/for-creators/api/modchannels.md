# Modchannels
Allows server side mods (SSMs) communication to client side mods (CSMs) and vice versa.

## Server Side API

### Functions

#### `core.mod_channel_join(channel_name)`
* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name

Returns an object for use with [Methods](#methods). Creates the channel if it does not exist and joins the channel.

#### `core.register_on_modchannel_message(function(channel_name, sender, message))`
* `channel_name`: string, modchannel name (already joined)
* `sender`: string, empty if from a SSM, player name if from a client
* `message`: string, message

Used for handling messages received from the client.

### Methods
{{< notice note >}}
`channel` here means the object returned by `core.mod_channel_join`.
{{< /notice >}}

#### `channel:leave()`
The server will leave the channel, meaning no more messages from this channel on `core.register_on_modchannel_message`

{{< notice tip >}}
Set the channel to `nil` afterwards to free resources
{{< /notice >}}

#### `channel:is_writeable()`
* Returns `bool`: `true` true if the channel is writeable, `false` if it's not.

* `message`: string, limited to 65535 bytes

Sends to all SSMs and CSMs on the channel.
