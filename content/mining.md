# Mining - Luanti Wiki


**Mining** is one of the most basic activities in Luanti. Mining is the activity of removing a node with a mining [tool](https://wiki.luanti.org/Tool "Tool").

How to mine
-----------

Mining requires the “interact” [privilege](https://wiki.luanti.org/Privileges "Privileges") (which is a default privilege).

Mining is done by [pointing](https://wiki.luanti.org/Pointing "Pointing") on the desired node and holding the attack button (Left mouse button by default).

Not everything can be mined with all [mining tools](https://wiki.luanti.org/Tool#Mining_Tools "Tool"). Some tools are better for certain materials. Also, mining often takes some time to finish. The mining speed depends on your tool and the node you want to mine.

Drops
-----

After a block has been mined, it may leave none, one or some [items](https://wiki.luanti.org/Items "Items") which go straight into your player [inventory](https://wiki.luanti.org/Inventory "Inventory"). The items left behind are also called the “drop” of the node and it is said that a node _drops_ something after being mined.

Most blocks drop themselves. This is also the default behaviour if not specified otherwise by the [modder](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mods "Mods"). But of course there are other drops possible, too. This is the list of possible drop types:

*   itself,
*   a different item,
*   multiple items,
*   _nothing at all_,
*   item or items based on chance (_probability-based drop_).

If the drop wouldn't fit in your inventory, the items literally drop on the floor instead.

Mining speed
------------

The mining speed is determined by [groups](https://wiki.luanti.org/Groups "Groups").

Mining in [Minetest Game](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games/Minetest_Game "Games/Minetest Game")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You start with a [hand](https://wiki.luanti.org/Hand "Hand") which is itself able to mine a lot of nodes already, but at the worst speed. [Axes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Axe "Axe") are good to mine [wooden nodes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Category:Wood "Category:Wood"). [Pickaxes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Pickaxe "Pickaxe") are good to mine [stone-like nodes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Category:Stone "Category:Stone"). [Shovels](https://wiki.luanti.org/Shovel "Shovel") are very fast at digging [dirt](https://wiki.luanti.org/Dirt "Dirt"), [sand](https://wiki.luanti.org/Category:Sand "Category:Sand") and [gravel](https://wiki.luanti.org/Gravel "Gravel"). Axes, pickaxes and shovels come in 6 variants: Wooden, stone, steel, bronze, Mese and diamond. In this order, the tools become stronger and stronger and usually mine faster.

**Most nodes drop themselves.** Notable examples for nodes which don’t drop just themselves:

*   [Stone](https://wiki.luanti.org/Stone "Stone") (drops 1 [Cobblestone](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cobblestone "Cobblestone"))
*   [Clay](https://wiki.luanti.org/Clay "Clay") (drops 4 [Clay Lumps](https://wiki.luanti.org/Clay_Lump "Clay Lump"))
*   [Coal Ore](https://wiki.luanti.org/Coal_Ore "Coal Ore") (drops 1 [Coal Lump](https://wiki.luanti.org/Coal_Lump "Coal Lump"))

Notable examples for probability-based drops:

*   [Jungle Grass](https://wiki.luanti.org/Jungle_Grass "Jungle Grass") (drops 1 [Cotton Seed](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cotton_Seed "Cotton Seed") or itself)
*   [Cotton (plant)](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cotton_\(plant\) "Cotton (plant)") (drops 0 to 3 [Cotton Seeds](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cotton_Seed "Cotton Seed") and 0 to 3 [Cotton](https://wiki.luanti.org/Cotton_\(item\) "Cotton (item)"))

Mining in other [games](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games "Games")
--------------------------------------------------------------

Mining basically works the same in all Luanti games. The tools and digging times are probably different, but the concept stays the same.
