# Map-Database valleys
Intro
-----

This is a collection of seed-value, descriptions and notable places for maps generated with [mapgen](/Mapgen "Mapgen") valleys.

Map as generated for [minetest-game](https://wiki.luanti.org/index.php?title=Minetest_Game&action=edit&redlink=1 "Minetest Game (page does not exist)"), without mods,  
with standard values for the mapgenerator as of version 0.4.16

Spawn is wherever I land when first entering the game.

This can be somewhat random from game to game.

Spot2 is a location not too far from spawn, with different landscape / [biomes](https://wiki.luanti.org/Biomes "Biomes").  
Spot3: one more location  
(Selected with an eye towards starting resources, such as [stones](https://wiki.luanti.org/Stone "Stone"), [trees](https://wiki.luanti.org/Tree "Tree"), [coal](https://wiki.luanti.org/Coal "Coal"), water)  
Remarks:

*   'ok' means this place looks suitable as a location to start a game.
*   '!' means starting here might be a challenge
