# Luanti Documentation

Welcome to the **Luanti Documentation** website. This is a work-in-progress effort with the purpose of acting as a central hub for well-maintained documentation about the Luanti engine, for players as well as for developers.

It was started from the remnants of the old Luanti Developer Wiki, and currently resides at the dev.luanti.org domain though this is subject to change. Content from the [Luanti Wiki](https://wiki.luanti.org) which is solely engine-related in nature is also in the process of being migrated over to here.

For more information about this site as well as how to contribute to the content, see [About This Site](/about-this-site/).

## Contents

All pages currently available are listed in the left sidebar, accessible through the hamburger menu to the left on mobile. Some pages are listed under categories and sub-categories, which can be expanded by clicking on the arrow icons to the right. The search bar also allows you to discover what is currently available.

The structure of the documentation is subject to change and a more proper content index will be available in the future.
