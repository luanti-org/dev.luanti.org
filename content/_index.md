# Luanti Documentation

Welcome to the **Luanti Documentation** website. This is a work-in-progress effort with the purpose of acting as a central hub for well-maintained documentation about the Luanti engine, for players as well as for developers.

Content from the Luanti Developer Wiki as well as content from the Luanti Wiki relating to the Luanti engine in general have been migrated here, and now redirect to their new location.

For more information about Luanti as well as how to contribute to this site, see [About](/about/).

## Contents

All pages currently available are listed in the left sidebar, accessible through the hamburger menu to the left on mobile. Some pages are listed under categories and sub-categories, which can be expanded by clicking on the arrow icons to the right. The search bar also allows you to discover what is currently available.

The structure of the documentation is subject to change and a more proper content index will be available in the future.
