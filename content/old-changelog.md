### Client Modding

* Introducing Client-Side modding (CSM for the initiated). You can now have local mods to read various client data and handle different client events. This new modding step is very secure, you don't have access to all standard Lua API, just a subset, to protect your computers. Mods should be installed in @user\_path@/clientmods.
* You will also have access to Client side commands, starting with a dot.
* If you want to know more about CSM API, please look at [Client Side Modding documentation](https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/doc/client_lua_api.md)
* Added by nerzhul, red-001, bigfoot547, Dumbeldor and paly2.

### Server Modding

* Enable mod\_security by default
* Add minetest.player\_exists() _(rubenwardy)_
* Add player attributes backend. This permits modders to store misc player related data to core and retrieve it after player loading. The attribute save is done by core. _(nerzhul)_
* Add mod metadata API permitting mods to have a standard way to write their own data. We recommend you to use this instead of your custom files backend. _(nerzhul)_
* Add position & anchor attributes for formspecs _(adelcoding1)_
* Add minetest.spawn\_falling\_node call _(zaoqi)_
* Remove core.cause\_crash Lua call _(nerzhul)_
* Add on\_flood server Lua callback _sofar)_
* Add clouds API _(bendeutsch)_
* Add private node meta to prevent some informations to be leaked to client (example: chest contents) _(sfan5)_

### Other / Misc

* Redis backend authentication support _(sfan5)_
* PostgreSQL < 9.5 support _(???)_
* Code refactoring (Game, Environments) _(???)_
* Introduce clang-format on repository to check and reformat C++ code with our rules (~15% source code managed) _(nerzhul)_
* Move external libs outside of src/ to lib/ _(nerzhul)_
* Update jsoncpp embedded lib to last C++03 version (0.10.6) _(nerzhul)_
* Disable leveldb on Android _(Ekdohibs)_
* Implement daily gitlab package build for Debian/Ubuntu/Fedora _(nerzhul)_
* Translations updates _(Multiple people)_
