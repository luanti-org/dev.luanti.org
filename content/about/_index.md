# About

Luanti is a free and open-source voxel game engine with its own [distribution platform](/about/contentdb) and [app](/about/luanti). Players, creators, server hosts, and engine developers can find more information here about how to get started with Luanti.

This site is created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with theme [Hugo Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/). The site's source content can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/luanti-org/docs.luanti.org/tree/master/content), and we welcome contributions from everyone. To contribute, see [Contributing to Docs](/about/contributing-to-docs).

## Getting Started

This site is organized by target audience:

- [For Players](/for-players) covers installing the Luanti app, installing mods and games, and basic gameplay mechanics.
- [For Creators](/for-creators) covers mod creation, game creation, texture pack creation, translations, and other guides for creating things with or for Luanti.
- [For Server Hosts](/for-server-hosts) covers multiplayer hosting setup.
- [For Engine Devs](/for-engine-devs) covers how to contribute C++ code to the Luanti engine itself.

## Luanti Documentation Mission Statement

Luanti Documentation is the central resource for the Luanti project. Contributors and writers can collaborate to author well-tested, understandable, categorized, and searchable information based on the current state of Luanti.

Documentation will cover:

- Comprehensive API reference, examples, and guides
- Engine reference and internal structures
- Server and platform (player-facing) usage and guides

This project began in December 2024. Our roadmap can be found at [GitHub issue #113: Roadmap](https://github.com/luanti-org/docs.luanti.org/issues/113).
