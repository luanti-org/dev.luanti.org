# Main menu music
Luanti supports music in the main menu, which can [be provided by games](https://minetest.gitlab.io/minetest/games/#menu-music) (5.5.0+). Previously it was possible to provide main menu music in [Sound Packs](https://wiki.luanti.org/Sound_Packs "Sound Packs") but this broke alongside the implementation of game-specific main menu music.
