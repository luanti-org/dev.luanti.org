# Mobs - Luanti Wiki


**Mobs**—short for **mob**ile**s**[\[1\]](#cite_note-wp-1)—consists of peaceful or hostile creatures that roam the world.

They generally appear randomly in the game world depending on lighting, height and spawning [block](https://wiki.luanti.org/Blocks "Blocks") conditions. Some of them may drop more or less precious [items](https://wiki.luanti.org/Items "Items") when killed. Mobs are created by [mods](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mods "Mods") only, so their exact behaviour depends on the mod or game you use. Technically, mobs are [objects](https://wiki.luanti.org/Objects "Objects").

Many [games](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games "Games") have at least some mobs. A notable exception is [Minetest Game](https://wiki.luanti.org/Games/Minetest_Game "Games/Minetest Game") which doesn't have any mobs (as of 0.4.16). There are [mods](https://wiki.luanti.org/Mods "Mods") which add mobs as well.
